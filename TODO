- learn taper distribution
- use mtype-based model to create diameters
- some hardcoded parameters could be put in json file
- collect morphologies that we can check with diameter-check
- make a script to run diameter-check
- update the readme/doc/.tex with the model
- maybe learn all with mtypes and select which parameters are mtype related, or from all
